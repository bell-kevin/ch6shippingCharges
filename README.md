# ch6shippingCharges
Write a program that asks the user for the weight of a package and the distance it is to be shipped. Pass this information to a calculateCharge() function that computes and returns the shipping charge, which will be displayed to the user. The main function should loop to handle multiple packages until the user enters the sentinel value of 0.  The function needs to determine how many mileage "blocks" there are in the miles to be shipped, because the rates are per 500-mile "blocks". There is a minimum charge of 1 "block", so if the package is shipping less than 500 miles, 1 block, it will be charged the same rate as if it were going 500 miles or 1 bock. If the miles are more than 1 block but less than 2 blocks, the company doesn't ship those extra miles for free.
